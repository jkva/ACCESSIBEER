# ACCESSIBEER

## What is it?
#ACCESSIBEER is an event during the Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference (CSUN) in San Diego. It was started as a way to get together with people outside of the fields that the host, Jon Metz, was working on. There's a lot of amazing people in the field of accessibility, so it was important to Jon to find some kind of common thread that could bring them all together.

## Why Beer?
Not everyone likes coffee.

## How does accessibility play into it?
The spirit of #ACCESSIBEER is derived from exploring the basic excercise of taking something that is generally hyperfocused on one kind of ability, and making it universally inclusive.  

##Some Background

Last year several attendees of CSUN went on a tour at [societebrewing.com/](Societe Brewing Company). Brewing beer is largely a visual process that requires some level of agility. What made the tour special was their approach to explaining how the beer was made. From the descriptions of the incredibly huge tuns holding the beverage during fermentation to the grains inside pint glasses that were passed around, we all learned a thing or two regardless of our various impairments. 

We also had a sweet backstage look at the [https://www.whitelabs.com](White Labs) facility where they grow the stuff that gives the loveliness that wonderful kick — yeast.

##What's happening this year?
We're planning on doing (What Jon believes is) the world's first accessible group brew. The idea is that we'd meet over a video chat and brew a beer together. Then we'll bring the beer to the conference.

If you don't want to brew a beer, or you don't want to get the necessary equipment for it, or you want to bre together, but you don't want to fly with it — you can still participate! At CSUN, we'll all get together for a real beer tasting. Those of us that brewed will be able to showcase those at the tasting. But those who didn't brew can go to a local store and get what's called a bomber here in the States, which is essentially a 22oz. tall single bottle of beer. Lots of brewers end up selling some of their best stuff only in this format.
